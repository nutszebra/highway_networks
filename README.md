# What's this
Implementation of Highway Networks by chainer


# Dependencies

    git clone https://github.com/nutszebra/highway_networks.git
    cd highway_networks
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

# How to run
    python main.py -p ./ -g 0 

# Details about my implementation
* Data augmentation  
Train: Pictures are randomly resized in the range of [32, 36], then 32x32 patches are extracted randomly and are normalized locally. Horizontal flipping is applied with 0.5 probability.  
Test: Pictures are resized to 32x32, then they are normalized locally. Single image test is used to calculate total accuracy.  

* Network detail  
Fitnet4 as [[1]][Paper]] said.

* Conv layers  
All conv layers are BN-ReLU-Conv

* T  
y = F(x)T(x) - x(1 - T(x))  
x: input  
F(x): non-linear function  
T(x): This fucntion is 0 <= T(x) <= 1  

T is calculated by BN-ReLU-Conv(3x3)-BN-ReLU-Conv(1x1)-BN-ReLU-Conv(1x1). The weights of all convs on T are initialized to 0 and all bisas are initialized to -1.ã€€The dimension of T(x) is same as F(x).
* Optimization  
SGD momentum with weight decay is used.

| momentum              | weight decay | initial learning rate | batch |
|:---------------------:|:------------:|:---------------------:|:-----:|
|0.9                    |0.0005        |0.1                    |128    |

Learning rate is divided by 5 at [60, 120, 160] and I totally run 200 epochs.
